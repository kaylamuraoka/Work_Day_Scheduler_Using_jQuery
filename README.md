# Work Day Scheduler Powered By jQuery

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Employees oftentimes have very busy schdules and utilize a daily planner in order to manage their time effectively.
